Refer Telusco jersey Rest using Maven in eclipse
src folder and pom.xml are the main.
project folder name is mtbs


1.This is Maven project created using Eclipse
2.In the pom.xml have to specify dependancy code for required jars
3.Inside src/main/java you have all the java classes.I have created separete package for each entity..Like Ticket,User..
Each package has corresponding POJO class,Resource class where API is written and DAO class for DB operations
4.inside src/main/webapp/js you have js files where jquery is writte.
5.inside src/main/webapp three html files are there.
6.Update src/main/java/com/mtbs/db/DBHandler.java with your postgresSQL port,username and password
7.It is not a complete project http://localhost:8080/mtbs/admin.html to access admin page..8080 is my tomcat server port and mtbs is eclipse project name
8.for user http://localhost:8080/mtbs/user.html
9.for manager http://localhost:8080/mtbs/manager.html
10.no login registration is added

It may not work when you clone since in eclipse maven each project have different name and version.and default web.xml also contains its default project name..So better crete maven project and copy paste content alone.
