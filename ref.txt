Refer Telusco jersey Rest using Maven in eclipse
src folder and pom.xml are the main.
project folder name is mtbs


1.This is Maven project created using Eclipse
2.In the pom.xml have to specify dependancy code for required jars
3.Inside src/main/java you have all the java classes.I have created separete package for each entity..Like Ticket,User..
Each package has corresponding POJO class,Resource class where API is written and DAO class for DB operations
4.inside src/main/webapp/js you have js files where jquery is writte.
5.inside src/main/webapp three html files are there.
6.Update src/main/java/com/mtbs/db/DBHandler.java with your postgresSQL port,username and password
7.It is not a complete project http://localhost:8080/mtbs/admin.html to access admin page..8080 is my tomcat server port and mtbs is eclipse project name
8.for user http://localhost:8080/mtbs/user.html
9.for manager http://localhost:8080/mtbs/manager.html
10.no login registration is added
11.Make sure netwotk is connect..since i added jquery online link in html file
12.Myresource.java and index.jsp are defaultly created by eclipse
13.In this ,for some APIs only I retured pojo class object or list of objects (User,Movie,Screen) which converted implicitly to JSON. for all Others I directly returned JSONObject or JSONArray 
It may not work when you clone since in eclipse maven each project have different name and version.and default web.xml also contains its default project name..So better crete maven project and copy paste content alone.
